# Binary Trees and Tries

We’ve already learned about linked lists, a basic way to store data in nodes. Binary trees and tries are more advanced node-based structures that store data hierarchically from top to bottom (in the shape of, you guessed it, an actual tree). But here’s where we get fancy: Nodes in a binary tree or trie can point to more than one node! Let’s explore how this works.

## Instructions 

Complete the activity as outlined below. When you are finished, submit an an issue answering the exit ticket questions to summarize your learning on this topic! 

## Learning Objectives 

- Describe how binary trees and tries are structured.
- Determine whether breadth-first or depth-first traversal is a more efficient search method for a given situation.
- Identify scenarios in which binary trees and tries are used in programming.
- Implement a binary tree.

## Prerequisites: 
* Linked Lists

## Activity

There are two components to this lesson, in the following order: 
1. myGA Module: [Binary Trees & Tries](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/8)
2. Exercise: Implementing a Binary Tree

**To do the in-class exercises, you can either...* 

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine and work in the relevant files
1. Use [this codepen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/jJOxBd) provided by the myGA Binary Trees module
1. Regardless of which way you choose, the exercises are the same (but the codepen has testing)
